Also, there is a silicon-rich intermetallic layer (light gray) at the interface between the steel and the coating. This etch, because of the nitric acid, also attacked the steel substrate, with some of the ferrite grain boundaries revealed. Galvalume is a tradename for cold-rolled steel sheet products to which a corrosion-resistant, hot-dip aluminum-zinc alloy coating has been applied. Galvalume sheet was developed by Bethlehem Steel, and it is applied by a continuous coating process whereby properly cleaned low-carbon, cold-rolled and annealed sheet steel is dipped into a molten aluminum-zinc bath.",

The ferrite contains a very low density of dislocations and is known as polygonal ferrite.

Mean grain size is approximately 10 micrometers compared to 30 to 40 micrometers for steel produced by older, conventional practices but not as small as the higher-strength HSLA steels. Ferrite grains are not strictly equiaxed but tend to have a rectangular shape (image 1) because the transverse migration of the grain boundary has been restricted to some extent. The pearlite present cannot be fully resolved by light microscopy (image 2) but regular lamellar pearlite with a lamellar spacing of 0.2 micrometers is resolved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (image 3). The pearlite is present in bands elongated in the rolling direction (image 2). A small number of isolated cementite particles can be detected by SEM (image 3) but are too small to be detected by light microscopy (image 2). These are cementite particles precipitated at the ferrite grain boundaries during cooling from A1 to room temperature (secondary carbides).",

The pearlite constituent is present in a comparatively large volume fraction due to the comparatively high carbon content and is concentrated in bands elongated in the rolling direction throughout the ferrite matrix (image 2). This can be attributed to segregation banding. The volume fraction of pearlite is noticeably higher in the central region of the strip (images 3 and 4) as a consequence of centerline segregation. The pearlite cannot be resolved by light microscopy but can be resolved by SEM to be regular lamellar pearlite with a lamellar spacing of approximately 0.1 micrometers (image 5).",

Individual ferrite grains are so small that they can scarcely be resolved individually by light microscopy at low magnifications (image 1).

Morphological details of the ferrite can be discerned only with difficulty after etching in nital to the degree normally used, as in image 2. More severe etching overcomes this problem but detracts from the visibility of other constituents (image 6). Molybdenum, combined with manganese, increases the hardenability and so increases the possibility of low-temperature transformation products other than pearlite forming during cooling after rolling. Lower bainite forms in steels of this composition, and the bainite contributes to the strengthening. Colonies of pearlite that cannot be resolved by light microscopy but can be resolved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to be regular lamellar pearlite are present. The volume fraction of this pearlite is smaller than that of other HSLA steels because of the comparatively low carbon content and because of the formation of an alternative transformation product, upper bainite. Upper bainite consists basically of sheaves of parallel ferrite crystals, as laths or plates (acicular ferrite), with discontinuous interlath cementite plates. Only small, infrequently occurring particles of interlath ferrite are present in these bainites, making recognition difficult. A typical example is labeled B in image 2. Low-carbon bainite may also be difficult to recognize in SEM because the cementite particles cannot easily be recognized (image 7). Recognition is easier when larger volume fractions of the bainite are present.",

The boundary of the matrix ferrite is comparatively straight in some cases, but in others a series of notches is present (arrows in image 6).

The density of twins increases with increasing shock pressure at a rate that also depends on many factors, including composition. In addition, the fine background structure shown in images 7 and 8 is developed, as are the normal large deformation twins, when the pressure exceeds a value of about 14 GPa (2030 ksi). /nA high-pressure shock wave traveling through a metal is composed of two separate pressure fronts. The first front creates the normal twins (one runs vertically in the center of image 8) together with numerous dislocations, whereas the second front causes the ferrite to change by rapid diffusionless atom movements (by martensitic transformation) to a phase with a close-packed-hexagonal structure. This phase, designated epsilon phase, undergoes a second martensitic transformation when the rarefaction wave that follows the two pressure fronts passes through. It is this second martensitic product (alpha prime) that can be seen in the background of images 7 an 8.",

In addition, the fine background structure shown in images 7 and 8 is developed, as are the normal large deformation twins, when the pressure exceeds a value of about 14 GPa (2030 ksi). /nA high-pressure shock wave traveling through a metal is composed of two separate pressure fronts. The first front creates the normal twins (one runs vertically in the center of image 8) together with numerous dislocations, whereas the second front causes the ferrite to change by rapid diffusionless atom movements (by martensitic transformation) to a phase with a close-packed-hexagonal structure. This phase, designated epsilon phase, undergoes a second martensitic transformation when the rarefaction wave that follows the two pressure fronts passes through. It is this second martensitic product (alpha prime) that can be seen in the background of images 7 an 8.",

Heating for more than 200 h is necessary for all colonies to be effected (images 4 and 5). Some portions of individual pearlite colonies resist breakup much longer than others. Once a colony starts to break up, the cementite becomes progressively more spherical in shape with heating time (images 2, 3, and 4), and the average diameter of these spheres becomes larger with additional time (images 4, 5, and 6). The sequence of events at lower (image 7) and higher (image 8) temperatures is the same, but the time required to achieve a given degree of spheroidization is approximately logarithmically related to temperature. Spheroidized structures are frequently desired to improve machinability and ductility and to develop a suitable structure for subsequent hardening treatments. /nMany of the spheroidized cementite particles are located at ferritic brain boundaries. The particles located at grain boundaries are somewhat angular in outline (particles B, C, and D) and only particles located within the grains are reasonably circular in section, indicative of a truly spherical shape (particle A).",

        "Description": "Aluminum-treated hypereutectoid steels exhibit fine-grained characteristics (images 1 to 8), but a complication arises because austenitization is most commonly carried out at temperatures between the A1 and Acm. The Acm temperature of this steel is approximately 965 deg C (1770 deg F). The cementite remaining undissolved at temperatures between A1 and Acm spheroidizes rapidly, even if initially present as grain-boundary allotriomorphs. The undissolved cementite is seen as bands of approximately spherical particles in images 1 and 2. The cementite dissolved during austenitization precipitates during cooling as partly continuous allotriomorphs, which adequately delineate the pre-existing austenite grain boundaries. A comparatively small austenitic grain size is produced when austenitization is carried out below the Acm temperature (image 1). All the cementite dissolves at temperatures above Acm and reprecipitates on cooling as continuous allotriomorphs, which again delineate the austenite grain boundaries (image 3). Comparatively small austenite grains are formed at temperatures up to about 1100 deg C (2010 deg F) (images 3 and 5), and abnormal grain growth occurs at higher temperatures producing very large grains (image 7). The dark areas in images 1 to 8, principally along the boundary allotriomorphs but also within the grains, are nodules of graphite produced by decomposition of cementite during slow cooling below the A1 temperature.",

Chains of etch pits are also developed along certain crystallographic planes within the grains of austenite. This is sometimes observed when grain-boundary sulfide precipitation alone has occurred. It can only be due to sulfide precipitation in this image, although liquation has occurred at adjoining grain boundaries. The two effects can develop together.",

Regions with a lamellar morphology are even rarer in approximately 0.6% C steel illustrated in image 5. Some cementite is present as short plates, but most is present as irregularly distributed globular particles. The structure of approximately 0.25% C steel illustrated in image 3 is even more markedly nonlamellar, the cementite being present as thick films with which embryonic lamellar grouping of cementite occasionally are associated (one group is indicated by an arrow in image 3.

The suppression of tempering can be detected, especially in locally deformed regions, after etching by any standard method (see images 1 to 3 where the light-etching areas are the plastically deformed regions), although the deformation patterns differ in detail.

Indicators of precipitates with a platelike morphology (acicular in section) are observed on irrational planes in the outer regions of the diffusion layers that have been comparatively slowly cooled after carbonitriding. The features are best seen at low magnifications, after comparatively light etching in nital (image 1). They are somewhat obscured but can still be discerned, particularly at higher magnifications, in images 2 and 3. The features are etching artifacts developed at the sites of gamma prime precipitates (see source for detail). Etching with nital develops a general effect in the ferrite grains, a moderately severe etch being required to develop the effect fully (compare images 1 and 2). The effect then appears at low magnifications as a general differential mottling of the ferrite grains and at high magnifications as systems of aligned pits (image 9). The effect decreases in intensity with depth, to a depth of about 600 micrometers in this workpiece. This is probably half the total depth of the diffusion layer.",

        "Description": "The case contains small spheroidal cementite particles. The cementite particles in the single-quenched specimen (image 18) result from incomplete solution of the eutectoid cementite during austenitization. Nearly complete solution of the eutectoid cementite would have occurred during the first austenitizing treatment of the double-quenched bar so that the cementite particles finally present (image 19) mainly would have precipitated during the second austenitizing treatment. Small spheroidal particles of cementite of this nature are always likely to be present in carburized cases quench hardened after austenitizing at comparatively low temperatures, but the amount present is likely to vary depending on the details of austenitizing treatment. The volume fractions of both the small spheroidal particles and the grain-boundary allotriomorphs are reduced in the outermost layer of the case (images 18 and 19), suggesting that the layer is slightly depleted in carbon.",

Wooden saw handle and box containing various iron nails and two split pins were discovered towards the stern. Given their function, location, and context, these were part of the ship's carpenter tool kit. Metallurgical tests were conducted, and demonstrated that the artefacts have a typical wrought-iron microstructure, and were manufactured by hot-working prior to surface hardening by a carburizing process. The investment in production of the fasteners suggests the ship was constructed by the authorities. This microstructure of the Iron nail shows a heterogeneous microstructure of: (a) ferrite at  nail's head; (b) widmanstaten ferrite and pearlite at the external surface of  nail's head; (c) parallel layers of low and medium carbon steel at the centre of the shank's lower part; and (d) ferrite matrix and pearlite (as typical to 0.3 wt% C) at  nail's tip.",
